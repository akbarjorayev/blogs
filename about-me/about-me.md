**I'm Akbar Jorayev — an 18-year-old Software Engineer from Uzbekistan**.

I'm always curious about how things work under the hood. Whether it's crafting clean code, experimenting with new tech, or figuring out the weird bugs that show up at 2 AM.

I'm curious by nature. I like asking "why?" and then going one layer deeper than necessary. Sometimes that leads to cool ideas. Sometimes it leads to chaos. Either way, I enjoy the process.

My journey into **software engineering** started in early 2022, when I first wrote my `Hello World` in HTML. That small step turned into a passion for building, breaking, and learning.
