## Education & Learning

2025 started with university exams as a freshman, I took my first semester's final exams and passed ✅, but it was only the beginning of the whole year.

Right after that, after the conversation with [Azimjon](https://t.me/Azimjon_Nazarov) (Java backend engineer), I started learning backend development. That was enjoyable, understanding how to create secure and scale backend infrastructures, which I only used the API to interact with.

In addition, I want to share some exciting news. After a long journey of learning and improving, sometimes even declining in my English. I got my IELTS 7 certificate. It certainly wasn't easy, and it took time, but eventually I nailed it!

Studying at Everest for 5 months and completing Cambridge 10–16 was extremely helpful; I definitely recommend it. Interestingly, I scored 6 on a mock exam right before the real test, but fortunately, the actual exam was different.

## Activities & Projects

Even though I launched my [telegram channel](https://t.me/akbarswe) in late 2024, I started "actively" posting things in 2025. Besides this, I started writing [blogs](/blog) here, so far I wrote three blogs about tech, and I believe that is only the beginning. There's so much more to share.

Writing blogs is not easy; you need to find a topic that is harder than writing a blog itself, then learn about it, and then it's time to write.

In 2025, I created seven MVP projects and guess what... I deleted five of them. You can find the codebase for the deleted ones on [archived GitHub](https://github.com/akbar-archive). I know it's hard to delete the projects that took weeks, some even months, to build and publish. But I am happy to try and recreate them by myself, I learnt a lot from them.

I gained real-world experience by working on my projects. I built everything from scratch, including the backend, frontend, and deployment. It was challenging but rewarding; more things were learned this way, which I will share in the future on blogs.

By the way, I had big dreams, and that's why I bought four .uz domains in 2025. But now I have no idea what to do with them 😅 Do you think I should keep them?

## Hackathons & Competitions

This year, I participated in my first hackathon ever, **INNOVATIVE AI HACKATHON 2025** at School 21. I joined the **AUTerian team** as an imposter; out of four participants, only I was from TUIT, the others were from AUT. It was delightful, I met new people, I felt what it's like to be at a hackathon, and of course, solved a problem.

We made a clean area bot, which tells government officials where trash is. Learn more about it on [telegram bot](https://t.me/cleanarea_bot), it is working so far, but I don't guarantee that it won't be deleted 😅

In early November, I participated in the [ICPC Uzbekistan Regionals](https://contest.yandex.ru/contest/84297/standings), and yes, all that LeetCode practice paid off! Two freshmen from TUIT and I teamed up to form the iconic **Infinitives team**.

There were more than 150 teams, and we secured 28th place (it was 27th before the final decision). We even had a chance to finish around 13th, but one problem with arrow-crossing blocks timed out at the last moment.

## Happy 2026

That's all on me so far, looking forward to staying alive in 2026!
