## Education & Learning

2025 started with university exams, as a freshman, I took first semester final exams and passed ✅, but it was only the start of the whole year. Right after that, after the conversation with [Azimjon](https://t.me/Azimjon_Nazarov), I started learning backend development. That was enjoyable, understanding how to create secure and scale backend infrastructures, which I only used the API to interact with.

And with that, I want to share exciting news, after a long journey of learning and improving, sometimes even declining my English. I got my IELTS 7 certificate. That was not easy and didn't take a short time, but eventually I nailed it!

## Activities & Projects

Even though I launched my [telegram channel](https://t.me/akbarswe), I started "actively" posting things in 2025. Besides this, I started writing [blogs](/blog) here, so far I wrote 3 blogs about tech, and I believe that is only the beginning. There's so much more to share.

Writing blogs is not easy; you need to find a topic that is harder than writing a blog itself, then learn about it, and then it's time to write.

In 2025, I created 7 MVP projects and guess what... I deleted 5 of them. You can find the codebase for the deleted ones on [archived GitHub](https://github.com/akbar-archive). I know it's hard to delete the projects that took weeks, some even months, to build and publish. But I am happy to try and recreate them by myself, I learnt a lot from them.

## Hackathons & Competitions

This year, I participated only in my first hackathon ever, **INNOVATIVE AI HACKATHON 2025** at School 21. It was delightful, I met new people, I felt what it's like to be at a hackathon, and of course solved one problem, which tells government officials where trash is. Learn more about it on [telegram bot](https://t.me/cleanarea_bot), it is working so far, but I don't guarantee that it won't be deleted 😅

## Happy 2026

That's all on me so far, looking forward to staying alive in 2026!
