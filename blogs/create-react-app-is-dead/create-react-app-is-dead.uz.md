Yes, [Create React App (CRA)](https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app) is officially dead.  

React, developed by Facebook (now Meta), remains one of the most popular libraries for building dynamic user interfaces. For years, CRA was the go-to tool for bootstrapping React projects, with over 200K downloads per week.  

## Why Should We Move On from CRA?  
CRA's performance issues — especially slow build times and outdated tooling — have made it impractical for modern development, particularly in large projects. As better alternatives emerged, its drawbacks became more apparent:  

- **Slow development updates** – Hot reloading and file changes take longer to reflect.  
- **Sluggish local server startup** – Starting the dev server is noticeably slower compared to modern tools.  
- **Inefficient builds** – Longer build times increase CI/CD costs and slow down deployment.  
- **Poor runtime performance** – Larger bundles and outdated optimizations lead to a slower user experience.

If you're looking for a replacement, here are two of the best options:  

### 1. [Vite](https://vite.dev/)  
Vite is a high-performance frontend build tool that dramatically improves speed over CRA. It provides instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR), modern ES module support, and near-zero startup time. However, it’s purely a frontend tool and does not include server-side rendering or API handling.  

### 2. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  
Next.js is the preferred choice for full-stack React applications. It offers server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and middleware, making it ideal for performance-focused and scalable applications.  

As the React ecosystem evolves, modern tools like Vite and Next.js provide a far superior developer experience compared to CRA. If you're still using CRA, now is the time to migrate.
